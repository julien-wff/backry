## Why Restic?

Using Restic as the "file system" for Backry is a bold choice, as it's not the tool's primary intended use.
However, Restic is battle-tested and has been around for a while, so problems *shouldn't* happen (though you should
regularly test your
backups anyway!). On the positive side, Restic is a very powerful tool that allows for encryption and deduplication,
which makes Backry a great solution (in my unbiased opinion). It also supports many storage backends, which is a big
plus. Implementing all these features by hand would have been long, tedious, and error-prone. The goal of Backry is not
to
provide a perfect backup solution, but rather a "far better than nothing" solution that is easy to use.

## Inspirations

This project is heavily inspired by [eduardolat/pgbackweb](https://github.com/eduardolat/pgbackweb), as both projects
aim to achieve the same thing. However, Backry improves on it by providing support for more database engines, more
storage backends, and
incremental backups.

It is also inspired by [tiredofit/docker-db-backup](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-db-backup), which at one point
was my database backup solution for my homelab. The desire for a similar tool with a friendly web interface kickstarted
the idea for Backry.

Finally, Backry's interface takes some elements from [StarFleetCPTN/GoMFT](https://github.com/StarFleetCPTN/GoMFT)'s
design, even though GoMFT remains prettier (someday I'll do a graphic overhaul).

## Was it vibecoded?

Nope, I only use GitHub Copilot's auto-complete feature (which is not that great with Svelte 5, btw).
If there are any bugs or issues, it's all on me :)
